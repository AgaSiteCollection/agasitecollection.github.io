    <h3>about this event</h3>
    <p>
      „Äå#AgaCosplay Invades: Bataan Tour 2024„Äç is the first-ever cosplay-centric
      provincial tour in the Philippines, where its main focus is to bring cosplays
      and hobbies close to home!! while this involves the incumbent First CosMaria's
      visit to every town in the province, every visit counts towards a focus for
      everyone to follow their own path.
    </p>
    <p>
      this event is led by the incumbent First CosMaria herself -- Aga-chuu, the
      First Maria -- alongside other cosers where applicable.
